## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SCSS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I learned about how to use SCSS to write optimized/minified CSS code and how together with BEM it makes it easier to write code.

- Since I used SCSS syntax for the first time, I followed a tutorial linked below to setup my workflow with the help of gulp to watch over my files and landed on some sites to help me with the syntax.

- I know the code is a little bit disorganized for this little project challenge but since this is the workflow that I am going to be using for the rest of the challenges , I tried to follow the same here.

### Continued development

- I want to become comfortable writing syntax for the scss on my own more importantly the intuition to use the use-cases that sass provides at the right place.

- Also the sass structure that I used for media queries is a bit confusing at this point so I want to get comfortable with that as well.

### Useful resources

- [Working with media queries](https://mastery.games/post/working-with-media-queries/) - This simple thing kind of helped a lot.
- [Coder Coder Sass workflow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krfUjg0S2uI&t=7527s) - This video helped with setting up a sass project with modular directory structure.
- [Master media queries by slaying the dragon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K24lUqcT0Ms) - This video helped me clear all the concepts regarding breakpoints. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
